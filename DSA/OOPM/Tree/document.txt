Q1. Explain non Linear Data structure?
Ans: A Data structure is non-linear when all elements are not arranged in a linear(sequential) order. There is no linear arrangment of the elements

There are two types of non-linear data structure
1. Tree
2. Graph

============================================
Q2. Explain Tree Data structure?
Ans: A tree is a connected graph without any circuit

Tree is a non-linear data structure which organize data in hierarchical structure and this is a recursive defintion.


if in a graph , there is one and only one path between every pair of vertices . then the graph is tree.

A graph is a tree if and only it it is minimumn connected.

Any connected graph with n vertices and n-1 edges is a tree.

Properties of Tree:
1. A tree with n vertices has n-1 edges.
=======================================================
Q2. Explain Tree Terminology?
Ans:
1. Root: Root Node is the origin of the tree data structure. it is the first node of the tree.

There must be only one root node and we can never have multiple root node in a tree

2. Edge: The connecting link between only two nodes is called edges

3. Parent Node: The Node which has a branch from it to any other node is called a Parent Node.

4. Child Node: A node that have a Parent node is called a child node.

5. Sibling: Node which belongs same parent are called sibling.
In other words node with same parent is called sibling

=============================================================================================================


Q1. Explain types of tree?
Ans:
1. General Tree: A tree where a node can have any number of children
    Flexible but not efficient for the operation

2. Binary Tree: Each node has at most two children
   Types of Binary Tree:
   A. Full Binary Tree: Every Node has either 2 child or 0        child, No node has one child

   B. Perfect Binary Tree: A FUll Binary tree where all leaf nodes are the same level, and all internal node have 2 children
   C. Complete Binary Tree: All level are completely filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.
   D. Balanced Binary Tree: A tree where the height difference at most 1(-1,0,1)
=======================================
1. Left Skewed Tree: A tree where each parent has only left child
2. Right Skewed Tree: A Tree where each parent has only right child
=============================================
Q1. Explain Binary Search Tree?
Ans: Binary Search Tree: is a Node based binary tree data structure which has the following properties
1. The Left sub tree of a node contains only nodes whose values less than the Parent.
2. The right sub tree of a node contains only nodes which is greater than the Parent node.
3. The left Tree and Right Sub tree also Binary search Tree
